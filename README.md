## Chartered Accountancy Firm website 

### Made using HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap library 

This project is a responsive website for a chartered accountancy firm which showcases the services, firm information, faqs and location. Developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. The website's frontend was built using HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, JavaScript for interactivity, and Bootstrap for responsiveness.

To ensure code quality and version control, I used Git and GitHub. I leveraged Git's branching and merging capabilities to manage different features and bug fixes separately, ensuring smooth collaboration with my team. Additionally, I regularly committed changes to GitHub, making it easy to roll back to previous versions if needed.

The website is optimized for search engines and features clean, semantic HTML markup, and CSS classes. The site has been tested for cross-browser compatibility, ensuring that it works well on different browsers such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge.
